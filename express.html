<marquee scrollamount="10"><b>The Delica series was replaced in June 1979 by an all new design, bringing overall width up to the maximum 1,690-millimetre (67 in) dictated by Japanese regulations for "compact" vehicles.[12] Suspended at the front by an independent wishbone construction and a leaf spring at the rear, the Delica also features sliding side doors and one-piece gas strut tailgate.[7] The line-up was expanded to include ten model variations encompassing a wide variety of passenger (eight seats in a three/two/three configuration[13]), cargo and recreational applications. A four-wheel drive option was made available in 1982, a first in the Japanese van market. Engines were all four-cylinders well known from MMC's passenger cars and included the 1,439 cc, 80 PS (59 kW) Saturn (4G33) and 1.6-litre Saturn (4G32) engines. A 1.8-litre Sirius (4G62) version producing 100 PS (74 kW) appeared in May 1980, and a 2.0-litre Sirius (4G63B) petrol version became optional in 4WD versions from November 1983.[14] A 2.3-litre Astron (4D55) diesel appeared in October 1982 and was replaced by the larger 2.5-litre Astron (4D56) in 1986.

The four-wheel drive version of the Delica was first introduced to the Japanese market in October 1982.[14] This versatile vehicle utilized a modified version of the Mitsubishi Pajero's chassis, albeit usually with smaller engines (originally only the 1.8-litre petrol).[13] After the introduction of the third generation Delica, the truck (separate cab) version of the second generation continued to be built until 1994. Japanese consumers were liable for higher amounts of annual road tax due to the larger engines installed in higher trim level packages.</b></marquee>

  <h2 class="evilbrotitties">ðŸ’¥ IMPORTANT NOTICE ABOUT HER/THEM ðŸ’¥</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>THE DEMON FAIRES: A WARNING, A MEMORY, A CYCLE UNENDING</strong><br><br>
    you don't <em>join</em> the demon faires. they <em>unjoin</em> you.<br>
    first the hair burns off your thoughts and the vowels start stuttering backwards like liquid clocks.<br>
    thereâ€™s a booth. it sells dreams. not your dreamsâ€”<em>someone else's</em>. you buy a kid's nightmare for five ticks of a static-wound pocketwatch and the barkeep cackles molasses.<br><br>
    
    <strong>THE SPINDLECLOWN KEEPS SCORE.</strong><br>
    heâ€™s not a clown. heâ€™s a concept. a wriggling sigh in the seams of meat-reality. his balloon animals bite. theyâ€™re real.<br>
    you try to leave.<br>
    but the EXIT signs spell <strong>TXIEE</strong> in flickering wet neon. backwards is the only way out. but <em>which way is that?</em><br><br>
    <img src="gifs/animated-skull-image-0014.gif" /><img src="gifs/animated-skull-image-0014.gif" />
    the demon faires donâ€™t <em>arrive</em>.<br>
    they <em>unhappen</em>.<br>
    one second the forestâ€™s calm, then the next thereâ€™s techno-calliope music bouncing between the ribs of the trees like echoing wrongs.<br>
    you ever seen a centipede made of brass and regret? it runs the merry-go-scream.<br>
    get on. get off.<br>
    youâ€™re still on.<br><br>
    
    <strong>TICKETMASTER IS A LIE.</strong><br>
    the tickets are carved into your memories.<br>
    you lose your 5th birthday for a corndog that whispers financial advice.<br>
    your motherâ€™s laugh buys you a turn on the galloping coffin ride.<br>
    screams optional. regret mandatory.<br>
    they donâ€™t take cashâ€”only <strong>chronoslip</strong>.<br><br>
    
    the faires run on time.<br>
    like, <em>literally</em>. they burn <em>time</em> to move.<br>
    every attraction consumes a decade.<br>
    kids enter adults. adults leave with baby teeth.<br>
    one guy turned into a calendar and now he just sobs Februarys.<br><br>
    
    <strong>THE DEMON FAIRES KNOW YOUR NAME.</strong><br>
    theyâ€™ve known it since before you had one.<br>
    theyâ€™ve got it written on the undersides of the carousel horsesâ€™ tongues.<br>
    you think that cotton candyâ€™s safe? itâ€™s insulation from forgotten futures.<br>
    eat it and youâ€™ll remember a lover who hasnâ€™t happened yet.<br>
    kiss them. they vanish.<br><br>
    
    <strong><em>STOP LAUGHING. THE POPCORN IS LISTENING.</em></strong><br><br>
    
    one time i made the mistake of trading eye contact with the Tilt-a-God.<br>
    now every 3rd word I say belongs to Him.<br>
    (hi)<br><br>
    
    the faires move in pulses.<br>
    not geographically. <strong>existentially.</strong><br>
    sometimes theyâ€™re outside Des Moines. sometimes theyâ€™re inside your kitchen drawer.<br>
    donâ€™t open it. donâ€™t open it. don't look under the spoons.<br><br>
    
    <strong>"COME ONE, COME NONE!"</strong> they scream.<br>
    because the more of you comes, the less of you leaves.<br><br>
    
    you ever met the Demon Faire Queen?<br>
    her crown is made of shopping receipts and her tongue is pure VHS tape.<br>
    she told me a joke once.<br>
    iâ€™ve never stopped laughing.<br>
    not once.<br>
    not in 9,000 years.<br><br>

    <strong>whatever you do, <br>
    <em>donâ€™t ride the Ferris Wheel backwards.</em></strong><br><br>
    <a href="it hurts my soul.html" style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">(more on Ferris Wheel)</a>
    youâ€™ll see your real face.<br>
    and itâ€™s screaming.
